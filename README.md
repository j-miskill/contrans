## DS 6600: Data Engineering I

This is a GitHub repository for UVA's Data Science 6600 (Data Engineering I) course. We will be filling out this repository over the course of the Fall 2024 semester. 

Our project centers around politician data. The project is called the Congress Transparency Dashboard. More specificially, we will be setting up a full stack app using Docker to query APIs and create some machine learning models to display useful information about politicians in the United States. 

We will be querying these APIs: (Congressional API)[https://api.congress.gov/], (Voting Records)[https://voteview.com/data], (Bills)[https://www.congress.gov/bill-texts-received-today], and a few others. These are openly available to the public and require no payment to access. 

This is an introductory data engineering course. We will be working with setting up systems and ensuring that data is wrangled and cleaned appropriately. We may set up pipelines. 


## Docker Hub Image

For this class, we have stored our Docker image on Docker Hub. The link to my Docker image is (here)[https://hub.docker.com/r/jcmiskill/ds6600inclassimage]. I named it `ds6600inclassimage` instead of the jupyter lab image.
